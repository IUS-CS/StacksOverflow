We plan to make a tower defense browser game using Nodejs as the server and phaserjs for the game code.
The game will have enemy sprites follow a randomly generated path. The enemies will have health and
the game will increase in difficulty. Players can purchase turrets to shoot at the enemies to kill them.
Killing an enemy improves a players score, score is used to purchase turrets.
