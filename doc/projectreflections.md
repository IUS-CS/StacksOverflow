 Phaser was an intuitive library and I feel as though the multiple examples helped a lot. I tried to refrain from just pulling in outside code as much
as possible so that I could learn all about Phaser organically. The most challenging aspect of writing the game logic was the decision to implement random
pathing. The algorithm for checking if two line segments intersect is complicated and while I am very pleased with the result, I wish I had been able to 
refine it further to disallow awkward paths to generate. I already had knowledge of node.js so creating the server was not difficult, however I had never used
express before and learning how powerful it is was very exciting to me. Finally, I really enjoyed using the jasmine testing library. It came with it's own html
to display the results of the test and I found it easiest to simply inject the logic script into that html file rather than use templates for everything. Overall,
I am very proud of the project and only wish I had more time to implement other cool features to it, perhaps I will in free time in the future.
