# Testing Patterns

Game functionality has been modularized into functions. The functions can be individually tested using the jasmine javascript library. A unit testing html page has also been created
and can be accessed in the src folder. Tests will include functionality such as validation of the random pathing, selection of an end point for pathing, and enemies losing health.
